# üèçÔ∏è McDeliveroo

This project aims to simulate the interactions between online food order in Singapore and the capacity of food delivery service. The simulation demonstrates a food order's journey from receiving, processing and finally delivering it.

  - **Context + Inspiration:** Many times customers were frustrated over the long waiting time of their food orders. In order to better understand the trade-offs of a company's considerations, we created a simulation that allows a user to modify different parameters to gain insights on the entire process

    From a company standpoint, this allows them to **discover whether one‚Äôs infrastructure and logistics** would be able to meet their expected average delivery time and average number of deliveries done hourly for each of one‚Äôs riders

  - _Challenges: Debugging javascript was quite tedious. I realised the final outputs of the simulation will vary depending the weightage assigned to the parameters. Finally, the path that was used to compute travel distance by rider is not realistic as it could be significantly shorter or longer due to weather and traffic conditions_

  - **_Technologies used:_** Vanilla Javascript
